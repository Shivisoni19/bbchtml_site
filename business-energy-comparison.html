                <p class="text__block-desc">
                  Comparing business energy offers a range of valuable benefits, extending beyond mere cost reduction. By regularly exploring business energy prices, you can discover more affordable gas and electricity tariffs, ultimately reducing business energy bills. 
                </p>
                <p class="text__block-desc">
                  Whether you need to renew your current contract or explore
                  better options with other electricity contracts, we can handle
                  all your needs. Our energy experts at BBC Utilities will help
                  you in fulfilling your business needs. Get in touch with us
                  for a quick call.

                <p class="text__block-desc">
                    However, the value of such comparisons is not just about cost savings but more than that. For individuals committed to reducing their environmental impact, choosing a green energy supplier, even with a slightly higher tariff, can represent a more meaningful and sustainable choice. 
                </p>
                <p class="text__block-desc">
                    This means managing your budget effectively and taking a proactive step toward supporting renewable energy sources and contributing to a greener and cleaner future.
                </p>
                <h5 class="text__block-title">What things should I think when I'm looking at different energy prices?</h5>
                <p class="text__block-desc">When you're checking out 
                  <strong>
                    <a href="https://bbcutilities.com/gas-and-electric-tariffs.html">
                      different gas and electric plans</a>
                  </strong>
                  , there are two important things to think about:</p>
                <ul class="list-items list-items-layout1 list-unstyled mb-0">
                  <li>The cost per KWH - This is how much you pay for every bit of electricity and gas you use. Different suppliers charge different amounts for this.</li>
                  <li>
                    The Standing Charge - This is a small fee that you pay every day to have electricity and gas supplied to your home. It can vary from one supplier to another, and it's important to consider.
                  </li>
                  <li>We will take care of your renewal or switch.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text__block-desc">
                  Sometimes, you might see a plan that offers a cheap 'cost per kWH,' but it might have a higher 'daily standing charge.' That can make your overall energy bill more expensive. So, it's important to look at both of these costs to figure out if a plan is a good deal.
                </p>
                <h5 class="text__block-title">What details should I gather to make an energy tariff comparison?</h5>
                <p class="text__block-desc">On comparing your energy tariffs the only prerequisite you need is your energy bill in hand containing:</p>

                    One of the main differences between home and business energy is the rules that apply to each group of customers. Home energy customers have the flexibility to switch their energy plans at any time, but there might be a fee if they do it before the contract ends. On the other hand, if you're a business energy customer, you can only change to a new supplier during your renewal period, which usually starts between one to six months before your current contract ends.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text__block-desc">
                    Another significant difference is how you choose your energy plan. Home customers can easily select from standard, ready-made energy plans, but for businesses, it's a bit more complex. To find the right energy deal for your company, you have to approach each supplier individually and request a customized quote. This allows businesses to get deals that match their unique requirements. However, it means you need to contact each supplier separately to compare rates and ensure you're getting a competitive business energy deal.

                    How to compare business energy?
