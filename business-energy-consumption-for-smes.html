                      Small businesses in the UK are facing financial
                      challenges, and cutting expenses is crucial for
                      maintaining your ground in the energy market. The
                      increasing energy costs in the UK can burden various
                      businesses, like shops and cafes. It's vital to avoid
                      overpaying for your energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Energy requirements differ among businesses. To simplify
                      managing a small business, it's essential to compare
                      prices for business <a href="https://bbcutilities.com/gas-and-electric-tariffs.html">gas and electricity rates</a>. This will
                      help you save on energy costs and ease the financial
                      strain.

                    <h5 class="blog-author__name">
                      What do you mean by a SME?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      SMEs, or small and medium-sized enterprises, are
                      businesses of a certain size. In the EU, they're typically
                      defined as having fewer than 250 employees. The UK's
                      definition is a bit more detailed. HMRC, which deals with
                      taxes, considers an SME to be a business with a turnover
                      under £100m and fewer than 500 employees.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="blog-author__name">
                      However, the UK government also aligns with the EU in its
                      definitions. Here's how it breaks it down:
                    </h5>
                    <ul
                      class="list-items list-items-layout1 list-unstyled mb-0"
                    >
                      <li>
                        A Medium Enterprise has fewer than 250 employees and a
                        turnover below £25.9m or £50m.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A Small Enterprise has fewer than 50 employees and a
                        turnover below £6.5m or £10m.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A micro business has fewer than 10 employees and a
                        turnover below £2m.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      SMEs play a significant role in the UK, employing millions
                      of people. Over 95% of UK businesses have less than 10
                      employees, and more than 99% fall into the SME category.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Examples of UK SMEs include sole traders, freelancers,
                      photographers, shops, tradespeople, hairdressers,
                      caterers, and contractors, among others. These are just a
                      few illustrations of the diverse range of SMEs found in
                      the UK.

                    <h5 class="blog-author__name">Measurement of SME Usage</h5>
                    <p>
                      Small and medium-sized businesses use meters to measure
                      their gas and electricity usage. There are various types
                      of meters for SMEs. Meters that require manual readings
                      can lead to estimated bills based on past readings. You or
                      someone from your business can read the meters for
                      accurate data, or <a href="https://bbcutilities.com/business-energy-suppliers.html">Business energy supplier</a> can send someone to
                      do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Smart meters are a great option for many businesses. They
                      provide real-time and precise readings, allowing you to
                      closely monitor your energy usage. The data from smart
                      meters helps you manage your business's energy
                      consumption, making it easier to reduce gas and
                      electricity costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Electricity usage is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh),
                      representing the energy needed to power 1,000-watt
                      appliances for an hour. Gas bills often use measurements
                      in cubic feet (ft3) or cubic meters (m3), which are
                      typically converted to kWh for billing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Many smart meters also display energy usage in terms of
                      how much you've spent, making it easier to understand the
                      financial impact of your energy use. This helps small
                      businesses budget effectively based on their energy bills.

                      Average Business Gas Consumptions in SMEs
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      Business Gas usage varies which depends upon the type of
                      business. For example, a café would use more gas than a
                      small clothing store. On the other hand, some shops don’t
                      even require a gas supply for their business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here are the average gas consumption figures for different

                      <li>
                        Microbusinesses usually use 5,000 kWh to 15,000 kWh of
                        gas per year.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Small businesses typically fall in the range of 15,000
                        kWh to 30,000 kWh annually.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Medium-sized businesses can have annual gas usage
                        ranging from 30,000 kWh to 65,000 kWh.
                      </li>

                      Electricity consumption is a common need for all SME
                      businesses, but the amount used can differ based on the
                      business type. Businesses might require electricity for
                      lighting, while others need a steady supply for things
                      like refrigeration or computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here are the typical electricity consumption ranges for

                      Ways to Save on Energy Bills

                      <strong>Continuously Monitor and Optimize : </strong>
                      Electricity management is an ongoing process. Regularly
                      review and update your electricity efficiency initiatives
                      as technology advances and new opportunities arise. Stay
                      informed about industry trends and emerging technologies
                      that can further enhance your energy-saving efforts
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Monitor and Track Energy Usage : </strong>
                      Implement an electricity monitoring system to track and
                      analyze your business's electricity consumption. This data
                      will help identify patterns, anomalies, and opportunities
                      for further optimization. Regularly review electricity
                      bills to ensure accuracy and identify any sudden increases
                      in usage.

                      <strong>Conduct an Energy Audit :</strong>
                      Start by conducting a thorough electricity audit of your
                      business premises. Identify areas where electricity
                      consumption is high and analyze potential sources of
                      electricity wastage. This assessment will serve as a
                      foundation for implementing targeted solutions to reduce
                      electricity usage.

                      If you find your energy bills rising, you can switch your
                      current tariff with the same supplier or you can compare
                      various tariffs of different suppliers available in your
                      location and switch to the <a href="https://bbcutilities.com/energy-suppliers.html">Cheapest Energy Supplier</a> which suits your
