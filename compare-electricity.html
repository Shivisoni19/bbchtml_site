                  Different Business electricity tariffs to compare
                </h4>
                <p class="text__block-desc">
                  When businesses compare electricity prices, the main thing a business should be aware of is various <strong><a href="https://bbcutilities.com/gas-and-electric-tariffs.html">business electricity tariffs</a></strong> or contracts. Let’s go through some of them.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-items list-items-layout1 list-unstyled mb-0">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Fixed-rate tariff: </strong>When you're running a business electricity price comparison. One popular option is called a fixed-rate contract. With this, you agree to pay the same unit rate you use and a standing charge for a few years, usually up to five. 
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Opting for a fixed-rate business electricity contract provides businesses with the benefit of predictable billing, facilitating more effective cost management. To compare business electricity rates and secure fixed-rate tariffs, businesses safeguard themselves against potential hikes in electricity prices per kWh throughout the agreement. This proactive approach helps shield businesses from fluctuations in the energy market, providing stability and financial security.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Variable rate tariff: </strong>When we compare business electricity rates, choosing a variable rate tariff means that the unit charge of business electricity can fluctuate based on the business electricity market rates. This kind of plan can be good for businesses that are looking to save money when business electricity prices fall.
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    However, since the unit rate changes with the market, there's also a chance that prices could increase. This means you might end up paying more at times. It's all about whether the business is willing to take the chance to compare business electricity prices per kWh to going up with the hope they might also go down.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rollover tariff: </strong>When businesses compare electricity prices, it's important to remember that forgetting to renew your business electricity contract can land you on something called a rollover contract automatically. This rollover contract typically lasts for a fixed period, usually a year, and legally binds the business to stick with it. However, the issue with rollover contracts becomes apparent when you compare business electricity prices. 
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    They often come with higher rates compared to what businesses could secure with a new electricity contract. This means businesses might end up paying more than necessary. Moreover, being stuck on a rollover contract makes it challenging for businesses to switch to better business electricity deals elsewhere. Therefore, businesses must stay proactive when they compare business electricity prices and renew contracts on time to avoid such situations.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Green electricity tariff: </strong>For Zero Carbon mission and environmental safety, many businesses are aiming to be more environmentally friendly by choosing business electricity plans that come from renewable sources like the sun and wind. These plans are called green electricity tariffs, and they're getting helpful with the companies that want to reduce their impact on the environment.
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Many business electricity suppliers are now offering these green electricity tariffs to businesses. This means that a small business organization or a large business has more options to choose from when it comes to picking an eco-friendly business electricity deal per kWh. By opting for green business electricity tariffs businesses get to do their part for the planet while also having more control over their business energy choices.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Pass-through tariff: </strong>Understanding a pass-through electricity tariff can be a bit more complex compared to other types of business electricity tariffs. Essentially, it splits your business electricity bill into two main components: fixed wholesale rates and additional rates covering things like National Grid levies and network costs. 
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    The fixed wholesale rates remain constant over a specific period, offering some stability in pricing. However, the additional rates, which include charges related to National Grid and network expenses, can fluctuate multiple times within a year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These tariffs are typically most suitable for businesses that actively manage their business electricity consumption and closely monitor energy market changes. If your business is proactive in controlling its energy usage and staying informed about tariff adjustments, a pass-through tariff could provide the flexibility and transparency needed to make informed decisions and potentially optimize costs over time.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Deemed rate tariff:  </strong>When a business hasn't signed up for a specific business electricity contract, they're automatically put on what's called a deemed rate tariff. These business electricity tariffs are known for being the priciest options available in the market. 
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Essentially, if a business has never agreed to a particular electricity contract, the business energy supplier will assign them to this default tariff. Unfortunately, deemed rate tariffs usually come with higher electricity rates per kWh compared to negotiated contracts. It's a situation where businesses end up paying more simply because they haven't chosen a specific business electricity contract. So, it's in the best interest of businesses to actively seek out and agree to a suitable electricity contract to avoid these costly deemed rate tariffs.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Flexible tariff: </strong>For large business electricity consumption organizations, buying all their electricity supply upfront can be a strategic move. By doing so, these businesses gain access to wholesale market rates, which can help bypass some of the additional costs associated with retailers. 
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Purchasing business electricity in bulk upfront allows these organizations to negotiate directly with wholesale electricity suppliers. This direct engagement often results in lower prices per unit of electricity compared to what retailers might offer. Additionally, by buying in advance, these organizations can hedge against potential price increases in the future, providing more stability and predictability in their energy costs. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, opting to purchase electricity supply in advance can be an advantageous strategy for large consumption organisations looking to manage costs effectively and optimise their energy procurement process
